# .dots

My dotfiles. Please have a look.

They are based on [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net) which we all love.


## Installation

1. Clone it into `~` (other locations should work, but that's what I'd suggest)
2. Bootstrap by running `script/bootstrap`

This will create a few symlinks into your home directory. It will also install [homebrew](brew.sh) and might in the future install more command line necessities.


## Inspiration & Credits

Most of the stuff in here is based [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/) and [robb/.dotfiles](https://github.com/robb/.dotfiles) (which itself took many things from holman/dotfiles). Thanks guys!

In general, most of the stuff has been copied from various places. Let's just call it common knowledge of the internet :wink:
